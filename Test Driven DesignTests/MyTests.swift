/*  what’s been created.
    We have a new class, called MyTests, which inherits from XCTestCase.
 
    There are four functions:
    setUp
    tearDown
    testExample
    testPerformanceExample
 
    The setUp and tearDown prepare the test and clean up afterwards.
    They are run every time for each test you write in this set.
 
    The testExample and testPerformanceExample are examples of different types of tests you can write

class MyTests: XCTestCase {
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        // Put setup code here. This method is called before the invocation of each test method in the class.
    }
    
    override func tearDown() {
        // Put teardown code here. This method is called after the invocation of each test method in the class.
        super.tearDown()
    }
